unit tests: check if associativity works

operator overloading (at runtime, not compile time)
enhance evaluation context for multiple use cases on the table
 - needs to be fully-plug-in ized

need to have like a "this" concept for the expression, which refers to the "environment map"

so you can do things like 

  "path ~= /home/file.html" => true|false @ new URL("http://domain.org/home/file.html")
    path would be a "member" of the environment map, which can just be a POJO
    and
  "callOtherFunction(this)" => true|false @ new URL("http://domain.org/home/file.html")
    this would refer to the entire object passed in

right - needs to work on Map<String, Object> OR POJO!

   Maybe Object... args, where arg[x] is Map or POJO?

this will be so cool...
