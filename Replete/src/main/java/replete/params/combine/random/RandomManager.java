// NOTE: A lot more thought needs to go into this class and Random-object
// management.  For example, there are use case considerations for ensemble and
// run and at the different layers of architecture: UMF platform (Java),
// Model/Simulator Plug-in (Java) and the simulator itself (any).  Also,
// why would the sim code that executes for a single run want to have the
// same random seed established each time it gets called?  Are there
// use cases for both yes and no?  Also, does the user get to choose whether
// or not to enforce a given previously-used random seed, and how does he/she
// do that?  Does user choose whether the choice is one for the whole ensemble
// or for the run (such seeds would reset before each new run).  Maybe
// we need a "domain" quality for our random number generators, so they can
// be somewhat hierarchically divided (a domain would be ensemble/run/something
// else perhaps?).  Maybe random seeds need to be saved for each run?  But
// that doesn't feel right because its so easy to change the # of runs per
// ensemble so how you would tie the run to the to the random seed?  At the very
// least I know that we might want to keep the random seed for the RNGs
// used in parameter set generation, so that people can remove the vari-
// ability of the randomness while they modify/test/verify their model.
// This can also be used for repeatability.  Without recording the random
// seeds you would never be able to perfectly reproduce results.  Also,
// consider the case of a single run.  Again we want to be able to perfectly
// reproduce a single run's results - and there is so "ensemble" in this case.
// So maybe thinking about this will help figure out what to do with random
// management.

// POSSIBLE USAGE NOTE:
// Any plug-in code using RandomManager, should not call new Random() nor setSeed.
// It breaks the contract of using this class.  All access should go through this
// class and next* methods in order to preserve potential future repeatability.
// This is because there's a usage confusion otherwise. WHEN did setSeed get
// set and to what seed?  If we allow client code to call these methods, then
// we can't help provide repeatability.
