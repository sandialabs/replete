/**
 * This class is intended to be the class listed in
 * a deployment JAR's manifest file for Main-Class.
 * The purpose of this class is to catch every
 * exception or error that occurs while launching the
 * JAR.  This is important because when a JAR fails
 * to launch properly, there is rarely an indication
 * of what went wrong.  The primary and most important
 * use case for this file is this:  if the JAR was not
 * packaged correctly and classes are referenced that
 * do not exist in the JAR, a hard stop would normally
 * occur sometimes without any indication of the failure.
 * The OS may report that the JAR encountered an error
 * upon launch, but cannot report the exception or
 * error thrown from within the JAR.
 *
 * Using this class as the entry point into a JAR file
 * ensures that at least *something* is reported back
 * to the user if a disastrous failure occurs.
 *
 * This class is self-contained, meaning that it only
 * uses built-in libraries that exist within the standard
 * JVM.  This is so this class itself cannot fail.
 *
 * This class is a template and cannot be "imported" and
 * used.  Copy this class into your project and replace
 * the code in main as needed.
