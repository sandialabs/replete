# Format:
# <verb-inf>, <verb-pres-part>, <verb-past-part>, <verb-past-tense>, <trans-type>,
#    <io-type>, <adverbs>, <dir-objs>, <alt-subjs>, <io-prep>, <io-after-only>,
#    <io-reflex-allowed>, <adverb-required>, <forbidden-types>

# The <verb-inf> is the infinitive without the "to" (i.e. "jump")
# The <verb-present-part> is the present participle of the verb (i.e. "jumping")
# The <verb-past-part> is the past participle of the verb (i.e. "jumped")
# The <verb-past-tense> is the past tense of the verb (i.e. "jumped")

# The <trans-type> is one of "TRANS", "INTRA", or "TR_INTR"
#  - Default: INTRA
#  - The transitivity of the verb.  An intransitive verb does not take a direct
#    object.  A transitive verb takes a direct object. However, a verb can have
#    both intransitive and transitive senses ("She sings well." and "She sings
#    only modern songs.").  Specify INTRA if the verb should never have a DO,
#    TRANS if the verb should always choose a DO from the <dir-objs> list and
#    TR_INTR if you want the verb to choose a direct object from the list only
#    50% of the time.

# The <io-type> is one of "IO_NO", "IO_YES", "IO_OPT"
#  - Default: IO_NO
#  - Whether the verb is allowed to or is forced to take an indirect object.
#    If IO_YES is specified, the verb will always be shown with an indirect
#    object.  If IO_OPT is specified, the verb will be shown with an IO 50% of
#    the time.  IO_NO does not allow IO for the verb.  Some verbs don't allow
#    indirect objects like "to think" (we never think to or for someone).  But
#    like "to say" or "to tell" almost always has one.

# The <adverbs> is a list like "L(word/word/word)" or "R(word/word/word)" or "null"
#  - Default: null
#  - If a list is supplied (not "null" or no argument) then 50% of the time one
#    will be randomly selected from the list and placed at the end of the
#    sentence.  Each "word" is a actually a "phrase" that can contain any
#    characters and punctuation other than "," or "/".  For example:
#    "L(quite quickly/a little bit/softly)".  You can use "R" instead of "L" to
#    make it "required" that a word be chosen from the list (i.e. instead of 50%
#    chance... 100% chance).  Same effect as setting <adverb-required> to true.
#    IMPORTANT: <adverbs> can contain non-adverb words like prepositional phrases
#    and adjectives.  In retrospect, this should be called <modifiers>.

# The <dir-objs> is a list like "L(.word/:word/*word)" or "null"
#  - Default: null
#  - The list of direct objects that the verb can take.  A direct object is
#    added if this option is non-null and either TRANS OR TR_INTR is supplied.
#    But if TR_INTR is supplied then the direct object will only be added 50% of
#    the time.  Each "word" is actually a phrase that can contain any characters
#    and punctuation other than "," or  "/" or ";".  Each "word" starts with a
#    ".", ":", or an "*".  The "." implies the word is singular, the ":" implies
#    plural.  Singular words are replaced with "it" 50% of the time.  Plural
#    words are replaced with "them" 50% of the time.  The "*" disallows any
#    pronoun replacement ever.  The actual word chosen is selected randomly from
#    the list.  You can also specify the exact pronoun to use if it is replace by
#    one using ";".  For example: "L(.my mom;her)".
#    Form:   (*|.|:)<obj>[;<prn>]
#    Where <obj> can contain two special characters, & and ^.

# The <alt-subjs> is a list like "L(.My arm/.My head/:My feet)" or "null"
#  - Default: null
#  - This list, if supplied, overrides the normal selection of "human"
#    subjects.  If this list is given then a subject is randomly selected from
#    this list instead of the usual 6 possibilities.  The subjects in the list
#    should all be 3rd person and be preceded by "." or ":" to indicate number.

# The <io-prep> can be "to" or "for" or any other preposition
#  - Default: to
#  - When an IO exists for the sentence, and it has been chosen that the IO
#    will be placed at the end of the sentence, this defines the preposition to
#    be used.  Most verbs will require either "to" or "for".  For example, we
#    SPEAK "to" someone, but we BUY something "for" someone - both are uses of
#    the indirect object.  Most verbs use "to".  You could use any other
#    preposition though - even "from" (even if it won't technically translate
#    to a indirect object).

# The <io-after-only> can be "false" or "true"
#  - Default: false
#  - Whether the indirect object can be placed after the direct object.  In
#    many sentences the IO can come before or after the DO as in "He bought me
#    the toy." or "He bought the toy for me." If the IO comes afterwards then the
#    preposition "to" or "for" is required.  However, for some verbs placing the
#    IO before the DO (w/o to or for or other preposition) can sound a little
#    awkward.  For example: "John plays me the piano on Saturday nights."  So you
#    can force the IO to come after the DO when this is set to true: "John plays
#    the piano for me on Saturday nights."  If not set to true, the placement
#    will be chosen at randomly - 50% of time before, 50% of time after.  This
#    option has no effect unless a DO is defined for the verb.

# The <io-reflex-allowed> can be "false" or "true"
#  - Default: true
#  - Whether the indirect object of a sentence can be the same person/number
#    as the subject of the sentence.  Imagine this sentence: "We sell our
#    house to ourselves."  It is grammatical but may not be the kind of
#    sentence you want the Sentence Generator to produce.

# The <adverb-required> can be "false" or "true"
#  - Default: false
#  - Whether an adverb should be selected from the list 100% of the time
#    instead of 50% of the time.

# The <forbidden-types> is a string
#  - Default: null
#  - Has two variations.  If the string begins with a - then the string
#    indicates all the sentence types that the verb is NOT allowed to partake in.
#    If the string begins with a + then the string indicates the ONLY sentence
#    types that the verb is allowed to partake in.  Here is a list of all current
#    sentence types:
#      PRESENT,       DO,
#      COMMAND,       WANT_TO,
#      TRY_TO,        NEED_TO,
#      GOING_TO,      PROGRESS,
#      QUESTION_PRES, PRES_SUBJ,
#      LIKE_TO,       LOVE_TO,
#      HAVE_TO,       SHOULD_TO,
#      WILL,          WOULD,
#      PERHAPS,       CAN,
#      ALLOW,         STOP,
#      INTEND_TO,     BEGIN_TO,
#      CONTINUE_TO,   PRES_PERF,
#      FUT_PERF
#    For example if a verb "to have" is not supposed to participate in the sentence types HAVE_TO and PROGRESS
#    (i.e. "John has to have a bite."  and  "John is having a bite.") then you should supply this string:
#    "-HAVE_TO/PROGRESS".
#    For example if a verb "to hurt" only makes sense within two sentence types PRESENT and GOING_TO
#    (i.e. "My head hurts."  and  "My head is going to hurt.") then you should supply this string:
#    "+PRESENT/GOING_TO".
